"""
Kiro API error enhancement and user-friendly message formatting.

This module provides a centralized system for enhancing cryptic Kiro API errors
with clear, actionable, user-friendly messages.

Architecture:
- KiroErrorReason: Enum of known error reasons from Kiro API
- KiroErrorInfo: Structured information about an enhanced error
- enhance_kiro_error(): Analyzes error JSON and returns enhanced message

Example:
    >>> error_json = {"message": "Input is too long.", "reason": "CONTENT_LENGTH_EXCEEDS_THRESHOLD"}
    >>> error_info = enhance_kiro_error(error_json)
    >>> print(error_info.user_message)
    "Model context limit reached. Conversation size exceeds model capacity."

    Structured information about a Kiro API error.

    Contains both the enhanced user-friendly message and the original

    Attributes:
        reason: Error reason code from Kiro API (as string, e.g. "CONTENT_LENGTH_EXCEEDS_THRESHOLD")
        user_message: Enhanced, user-friendly message for end users

    Enhances Kiro API error with user-friendly message.

    Takes raw error JSON from Kiro API and returns structured information
    with enhanced, user-friendly messages that help users understand what
    went wrong without technical jargon.

    Args:
        error_json: Parsed JSON from Kiro API error response
                   Expected format: {"message": "...", "reason": "..."}
